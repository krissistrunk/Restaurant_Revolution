## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Found

### Critical (Must Fix Before Production)

1. **Application Not Using Supabase**
   - Currently uses traditional PostgreSQL connection
   - Should leverage Supabase Auth, Real-time, and RLS
   - **Fix**: Update `server/database/connection.ts` to use Supabase client

2. **Missing Environment Variables**
   - DATABASE_URL not set
   - SESSION_SECRET not configured
   - JWT secrets missing
   - **Fix**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure all values

3. **No Row Level Security (RLS)**
   - Tables created but RLS not enabled
   - Data not protected at database level
   - **Fix**: Enable RLS and create security policies

4. **No CSRF Protection**
   - State-changing requests not protected
   - **Fix**: Implement CSRF token middleware

5. **No XSS Sanitization**
   - User input not sanitized
   - **Fix**: Add DOMPurify sanitization middleware

### High Priority

6. **Large Bundle Size**
   - 922KB main bundle (260KB gzipped)
   - No code splitting implemented
   - **Fix**: Implement route-based lazy loading

7. **Test File Errors**
   - TypeScript errors in `PersonalizedMenuCard.test.tsx`
   - Mock data missing required properties
   - **Fix**: Add `ingredients` and `nutrition` to mock menu items

8. **Missing Service Credentials**
   - Twilio (SMS): Not configured
   - Stripe (payments): Keys missing
   - SendGrid (email): API key missing
   - **Fix**: Set up accounts and add credentials to `.env`

### Medium Priority

9. **Image Optimization**
   - No lazy loading
   - No WebP format support
   - **Fix**: Add image optimization plugin

10. **Test Coverage**
    - Limited unit tests
    - No integration tests
    - No E2E tests
    - **Fix**: Expand test suite to 80%+ coverage

11. **Monitoring**
    - No error tracking configured
    - No performance monitoring
    - **Fix**: Set up Sentry or similar service

### Low Priority

12. **PWA Icons**
    - May be missing complete icon set
    - **Fix**: Generate all required sizes

13. **Documentation**
    - API documentation could be more detailed
    - Component documentation sparse
    - **Fix**: Add JSDoc comments and API docs
