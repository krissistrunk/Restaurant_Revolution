Below is a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) tailored for a white-label restaurant app to be developed by Replit Agent, an AI app builder. Augmented Reality (AR) is excluded as per your request, and the focus is on core and innovative features that are customizable for restaurants. I’ve included detailed user flows, wireframe descriptions, and code snippets to ensure clarity for the AI builder.

@app.route('/register', methods=['POST'])
def register():
    data = request.json

function Menu() {
    const [menu, setMenu] = useState([]);

    useEffect(() => {

    }, []);

    return (
        
            {menu.map(item => (
