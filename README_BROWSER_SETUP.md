## 🔄 Development vs Production

The app is configured to run in **production mode** for the browser, which serves the built static files. This provides:
- ✅ Faster loading
- ✅ Optimized bundles
- ✅ Better stability
- ✅ No complex dev dependencies

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Port already in use**: Change the port number
   ```bash
   PORT=5002 npm start
   ```

2. **Build issues**: Rebuild the app
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Server won't start**: Check if built files exist
   ```bash
   ls -la dist/
   ```

## 📊 Server Logs

Check `app.log` for server output:
```bash
tail -f app.log
```
