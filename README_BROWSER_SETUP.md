## 🛠️ Technical Details

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Radix UI
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- **Database**: In-memory storage (no PostgreSQL required)
- **Build Tools**: Vite (frontend) + esbuild (backend)
- **SMS Service**: Twilio integration for professional notifications

## 📞 SMS Setup (Optional)

To enable SMS notifications for the waitlist features:

1. **Get Twilio Account** (Free trial available)
   - Sign up at https://www.twilio.com
   - Get your Account SID, Auth Token, and Phone Number

2. **Add Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   export TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="your_account_sid"
   export TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="your_auth_token" 
   export TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER="+1234567890"
   ```

3. **Test SMS Features**
   - Join waitlist with phone number
   - SMS notifications will be sent for position updates and table ready alerts
   - Special occasion messages sent automatically

**Note**: SMS features work without Twilio - they'll just log messages instead of sending real SMS.

## ✅ What Was Fixed

1. **TypeScript Errors** - Resolved all 31+ type errors
2. **Database Issues** - Configured in-memory storage fallback
3. **Build Process** - Fixed frontend and backend builds
4. **Server Configuration** - Fixed port handling and static file serving
5. **Development Mode** - Configured to use production mode for reliability

## 🔄 Development vs Production

The app is configured to run in **production mode** for the browser, which serves the built static files. This provides:
- ✅ Faster loading
- ✅ Optimized bundles
- ✅ Better stability
- ✅ No complex dev dependencies

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Port already in use**: Change the port number
   ```bash
   PORT=5002 npm start
   ```

2. **Build issues**: Rebuild the app
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Server won't start**: Check if built files exist
   ```bash
   ls -la dist/
   ```

## 📊 Server Logs

Check `app.log` for server output:
```bash
tail -f app.log
```
